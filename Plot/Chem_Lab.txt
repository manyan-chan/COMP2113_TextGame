`Chemistry Laboratory`

1st visit: You are trying to apply what you have learnt. You take out a 1M Sodium Chloride and 1M Hydrochloric Acid. You carefully measure 100cm3 of NaOH and 100cm3 of HCl and plan to mix them together to get the water as the product. You know it is risky. However, in order to survive, you have no choice. Are you sure you want to do so?

Yes: You prepare everything. You are going to pour all the acid inside the alkaline solution. All of a sudden, you hear a loud noise and are  distracted. You accidentally splash some acid on your hand. You yell but nobody reply. As a result, you are forced to use some water to wash it.

[water--]

No: You are considering: what if the concentration is not exactly 1M? what if there are error in measuring the volume? you are struggling. In the end, you are hesitated and tell yourself: "next time". 
You put down all the apparatus and leave. 

[(no change)]

2nd visit: This is the 2nd time that you visit the chemistry lab. You look around and find all the things are gone. Suddenly, you hear some someone is outside the door. You hide under the desk. 

"I am checking if there are anything useful in the chem lab",a young girl says. She seems to be less than 18 years old and shorter than 155cm. You see her hands are holding 3 masks. You are going to: 

Outcome [A] Take out a stick from your bag and hit her:
 
"Now your masks are all mine". You yell and hit her head critically. You see she is bleeding and looking at you. You feel guilty. However, if you are clear that if you do not do so, you may run out of masks in the future and die.

You get 3 masks. 

[mask = mask + 3]. 
[brutal_count ++]


Outcome [B]: Introduce yourself

You stand up with your hands raised up. "Hi this is (username)..." and start your self-introduction.

In the conservation, you know she is called Ashley. You are now friends with her. In the chat, you acknowledge that she is running out of food and she is willing to give out 3 masks for 1 food and 1 water. Are you going to accept the offer?

	Outcome [A]: Yes
	[mask = mask + 3]
	[food--]
	[water--]
	"Thanks for the things."

	Outcome: No
	"No thanks, probably next time."

3rd visit: This is the third time visiting the chemistry lab. You find nothing and you decide to leave.

You walk out the room and feel dizzy suddenly. You feel headache and start to fade away. Before fainting, you see a man with an iron stick behind you. After 15 mins, you wake up and find all your belongings are gone. If you cannot find any equipment (i.e. food or water or mask) in before tommorrow. You will die.
